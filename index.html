Download the latest version
(25 Sep, 2023),
<a href="https://icedrive.net/s/A2RQj3zXDZagX19i9BA8T2yi6GZ4">dynamic</a>
or
<a href="https://icedrive.net/s/vDDw9aCwQ49SvvFv6Fj2wwRhwYuv">static</a>;
more information enclosed. They should work on most any x86-64 Linux &amp; BSD.
<br>This is a <i><b>7-year-in-the-making</b> release</i>, and exceptionally includes some significant new features, mostly aimed to make the game a bit less frustrating.
See the <a href="changes.html">changelog</a> for more details. (The proper anniversary date is Oct 2nd, but I shall be travelling at that time and therefore push an
early release.) Also, the binaries are now hosted on a paid file server, so the links should actually keep working...</p>

<p><b>Please note:</b> the <i>static</i> version is fully stand-alone, but has
minor, unfixable issues arising from the use of netbsd-curses. The <i>dynamic</i>
version requires <tt>libc.so.6</tt> and <tt>libncursesw.so.6</tt> present on your
system.</p>

<p>Bug reports &amp; such: send a free-form e-mail to <em>lotuskip</em> at the
well-known Google world-domination mail domain, with 'roguemare' in
the subject line. I'spose you can also open an issue here on Github.</p>
