<p><b>The 2FA requirement was the last drop, and I am abandoning github. Since I do little programming these days anyway,
I am not switching to an alternative, either. This page won't be updated anymore, and whether github decides to delete
it later doesn't concern me. I will try to keep the links in RogueBasin up to date, instead.</b></p>
<hr>
<p>This page used to exist to host the closed-source roguelike 'Roguemare'.
At the time of the last update, the location to download the lastest version was still
<a href="https://icedrive.net/s/NFX64wf3Y4buj2SbuPQ79bj3Vzxx">this</a>.
There's a dynamically as well as a statically linked version available.
They should work on most any x86-64 Linux &amp; BSD.</p>

<p><b>Please note:</b> the <i>static</i> version is fully stand-alone, but has
minor, unfixable issues arising from the use of netbsd-curses. The <i>dynamic</i>
version requires recent versions of GNU libc and ncurses.</p>

<p>Bug reports &amp; such: send a free-form e-mail to <em>lotuskip</em> at the
well-known Google world-domination mail domain, with 'roguemare' in
the subject line.</p>
